Feel free to contribute to this repository with pull requests! Here are some guidelines:

* Don't contribute to remove something, only to add something.
* Feel free to contribute by cleaning up the code.
* Fix my bad code (there's lots of it.)
* Contributions must be fully tested before you do a PR.

And that's it!
